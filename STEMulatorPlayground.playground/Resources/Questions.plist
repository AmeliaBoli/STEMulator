		<string>I need to buy a new toy for my 5 year-old niece.</string>
        <key>GeneralResponse</key>
        <string>Any toy that encourages problem solving, spatial reasoning, and mechanics is a win for supporting growth into STEM. But we might have a larger problem of advertising and marketing in our society. Some believe that the heavily gender branded toys in our stores are creating more distance between boys and girls at earlier ages. This becomes a bigger question of how men and women interact in our society as a whole.</string>

                <string>Yes! Just changing the wall from blue to red still leaves "boy" and "girl" aisles. Why can't cars and dolls be across from each other?</string>

        <string>As K12 educator, how can encourage STEM growth in my students?</string>
        <key>GeneralResponse</key>
        <string>Turns out, this is an extemely complicated question. Just a few suggestions, encourage learning and self-driven discovery through topics that the student is interested in. Every child, regardless of gender or "skill level" is capable of exceling in their own way. Not everyone is going to become a programmer, and that is okay. But let's create an education system where it is possible to learn this.</string>
